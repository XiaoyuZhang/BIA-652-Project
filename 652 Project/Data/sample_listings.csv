Also the doors in the older part of the house are not high - anyone over about 6 foot 2 / 188 cm should take care. The parking space outside the house is generally _not_ available for guest use, at least not during the week in term time. Please enquire if you want to know about parking. There are public car parks nearby.","Trains go from London Waterloo to Kingston (a ten-minute walk) and Norbiton (slightly further).

The thing that sets it apart from other similar areas around London is the beautiful Thames riverside and the green space - both Richmond and Bushy Park are stunning deer parks with acres of woodland and heathland walks to enjoy.  If you like cosy pubs there are loads to choose from, most with excellent food and real ale/craft beers on tap.",Please note - our home isn't really suitable for groups of single guests. We don't accept single sex parties or groups of people under 20 - sorry.

Surbiton station is 20min walk and allows quick access to south west England without needing to bother with central London. Lots of nice walking and cycling routes along the river and through Richmond Park/Bushy Park.

Kingston is a busy market town with a wealth of shops, pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants that cater for all tastes.   It's a friendly and safe area.  Hampton Court Palace is a 10 minute drive or a 50 minute walk along the river too.  Richmond is also very close by (a 50 minute walk through the park or a 20 minute bus ride away).

Just down the hill from us (7 minutes on the bus or a 20 minute walk) is the Crystal Palace football stadium, and a little further afield you'll find Dulwich (site of the world's oldest private art gallery), Croydon, Bromley, Sydenham, and Penge.",,"Bus stops (100 yards from the house) take you straight to Crystal Palace station (7 mins),  Croydon, Brixton (20 mins), and Elephant And Castle (close to London Bridge). Crystal Palace station is on the brand new Overground line into central London, and also has links to London Bridge and Victoria stations.   Norwood Junction station is near the Crystal Palace football stadium, and offers fast trains to London Bridge (17 mins) There's also the Number 3 bus which takes a route through Brixton, past Big Ben, Downing Street, Trafalgar Square and up to Oxford Street - a fairly long journey (an hour or so) but one which takes in some of the sights of London.  The bus leaves every 6 mins or so.","You'll have full access to the open plan communal areas - the dining room, and living room.  You can use the kitchen when you like, and I'm generally cooking something most nights! I have a wall-sized cinema projector TV, so if you fancy a night in, come with ideas for a film night, and I'll see if I can get your request on lovefilm!  The garden and patio are open to guests and make a great place for a BBQ or a glass of wine (and for those with children, there's a small playground within sight of the house).  The garden backs onto a local woodland park, so it's regularly visited by squirrels, foxes, woodpeckers and surprisingly, even London's local parrots!   Come and relax.","I'm a writer and animator, and I work from an office in the garden.  This means I'm usually around to help with anything you need.   I've got two young children, who are sometimes around, and I'm usually cooking something interesting most nights.   I've lived in South East London for over 20 years, so I know my way around the city pretty well, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you've got, and help in any way I can during your stay.",Please do not leave dead bodies in the cupboard.,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/99767589/4ed7c5c3_original.jpg?aki_policy=small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/99767589/4ed7c5c3_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/99767589/4ed7c5c3_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/99767589/4ed7c5c3_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large,19342820,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19342820,Christian,8/2/14,"London, United Kingdom","I'm an animator and writer of children's books, so I work from an office in the garden, and I'm around most of the time.

Bromley Town Centre, recently pedestrianized, is a shopping oasis and features the Glades shopping centre plus a number of good shops and restaurants.

Pets are welcome, but we will ask guests who choose to bring pets to pay å£40 cleaning fee to cover the extensive clean we have to do after having animals to stay. Though we do like having animals around we do ask that dog owners keep dogs on the lead in the garden as we have young children. There are extensive woodlands (and a river) just around the corner in which dogs can have the freedom to run.","Ravensbourne station is a ten-minute walk away, and runs a regular service of trains into central London terminals, with Blackfriars and St. Pancras International just 30 and 40 minutes away respectively.

The area has good local bus routes, 3 minutes into bromley town centre, which is a shopping oasis with high street shops as well as the newly renovated 'intu' shopping centre ((website hidden)) .

He gives the best to his guest, to make them feel confortable.He always has a joke or two about many subjects. Chatting with him is just a pleasure as he knows a lot about many subjects: you will share ideas and real conversation not only about the weather.Rakesh is an excellent cooker, I loved the indian food he made. And, as I am a vegetarian, he always took a good care my food did not touched meat. I thought it was sweet and kind from him as he did not has to think about it.Rakesh, Tim and I had a lovely time with you and hope you enjoy what we shared together.Thank you a lot.From lucila Masera Madrid, SpainRakesh es una de las personas mÌÁs generosas que conocÌ_ en mi vida. Nos preparÌ_ comida riquÌ_sima todos los dÌ_as y nos ayudÌ_ con todo lo que necesitabamos. Fue mi primera vez haciendo couchsurfing y realmente fue una muy linda experienciaMadeleine Turner La Verne, United States  PositiveRakesh was one of the most welcoming and altruistic people Megan and I have ever met. When we arrived at his home he provided us a delicious cooked meal, then proceeded to show us parts of London which are off the beaten track for the average tourist. It was a very comfortable stay.If he was ever in California, we would be happy to host him!Johannes Rau Saarbruecken, Germany Aug 1 4 days  PositiveObwohl noch AnfÌ_nger auf Couchsurfing, habe ich gleich mit meinem ersten Host viel GlÌ_ck gehabt. Pappu ist ein sehr hilfreicher und sorgender Gastgeber und ermÌ¦glichte so mir und meiner Tochter ein spannendes Wochenende in London (mit Kindern ist die Hostsuche eh schon viel schwieriger). Gab uns viele gute Tipps und wir hatten interessante GesprÌ_che Ì_ber Reisen, Frankreich und Wein (inkl. kurzer Kinoshow -- ein Kurzfilm mit Gerad Depardieu). Auch unsere schrecklichen An- und Abreisezeiten waren kein Problem fÌ_r ihn. Vielen Dank und gerne wieder!! :)From Yeji Jo Busan, South Korea Jul 30 Met in person Surfed 3 days  PositiveRakesh  is a very amazing man. He offered me (and my friend )everything he can. He gave us pretty cozy place to sleep and very delicious food and tea. Ola SÌÉÛ_awiÌÉÛ_ska Rugby, England Jul 21 3 days  PositiveRakesh is a very kind, knowledgeable man who can prepare a DELICIOUS dinner and make you laugh while you are enjoying the food. He is the best guide, and staying with him was a pure pleasure. He told us (me and my boyfriend) what we should visit in London such as Tate Modern or Japanese Tea Ceremony on Piccadilly. It was amazing! He also explained to us how to move around the City which proved to be very helpful. In the evenings we sat and talked about everything. He shared with us a lot of experiences and stories about his past and travels. It is a shame we stayed with Rakesh only for two nights but our stay was full of fun and unforgettable time. Thank you very much and I hope to meet you again very soon!Cezary LipiÌÉÛ_ski Nottingham, England Jul 21 Met in person Surfed 3 days  PositiveRakesh is a very kind and genuine man, he has done a lot of things in his life, and has extensive knowledge on a variety of subjects. You can spend hours and hours on discussions on music, politics, travels or art.He is a great cook - he made us several dishes (e.g. a great Indian Soup made to his mother's recipe). We had a great time listening to some of the stories from his past, for example an elephant stealing bananas from a banana tree in his back garden in India! He knows London like nobody else and he proved to be priceless when it came to advising us on what to see and how to get there. He was always very generous to us and happy to help. We could not have wished for a better host. And we hope to meet him again in the very near future. Thank you once again. Tina Liashchuk Wroclaw, Poland Jul 20 Met in person Surfed 3 days  PositiveMany thanks to Rakesh, it was really lovely experience to stay at his place. Wise man with good heart, thoughtful, very experienced and educated, I could spend hours talking to him. Rakesh gave us some very useful tips what to see in London. Also he is a god cook, indian food was really delicious!I hope to see you in Poland!Francesco Savi Terranova dei Passerini, Italy Jul 19 Met in person Surfed 3 days  PositiveTime permitting, I can be a good guide too. One can get an idea of London as explored by me and my guests...A reference from a guest from Brazil: I think there are two kinds of hosts: the ones who just rent you a room and expect you to respect a list of rules and there are the ones who cares about your travel experience. Rakesh is definitely in the second group. I told him, before I get in there, that I'd twisted my feet, so a cane was waiting for me. He always was interested in knowing about my day and plans and he tried to help as much as he could, even taking me to places. My room had a nice view of trees and rooftops of Crystal Palace. The flat is really close to rail station and a bus stop is just in front. Close to the rail station there is a Tesco, so I usually bought my lunch there and then would eat during the 30 a hour silent train trip to the center city.November 2013One guest from Rome, Italy writes:Rakesh is a nice host, ready to meet your needs, to exchange chats and cultural opinions, travel and cooking experiences; probably, you should not even ask: he will be friendly helpful in everything.
